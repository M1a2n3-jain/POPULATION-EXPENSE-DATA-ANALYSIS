# POPULATION-EXPENSE-DATA-ANALYSIS
1. Description of Project:This project involved a comprehensive data analysis of population demographics and corresponding expense data, utilizing Power BI for end-to-end processing and visualization. I transformed raw data into interactive dashboards, revealing key trends and relationships between population shifts and spending patterns. The insights gained offer valuable perspectives for strategic planning and resource allocation. This project showcases my ability to leverage Power BI for insightful data visualization and reporting, turning complex datasets into actionable business intelligence.
2. Key Technologies used to build this Dashboard:
üìä Power BI Desktop - Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
ü§ù Power Query - Data Transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing data.
üìÑ Data Modeling - Relationships established among tables to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
üìÅ File Format - .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
3. Key Features/Highlights:
   The primary goal of creating a Population and Expense Data Analysis dashboard using Power BI is to transform raw, disparate data into actionable insights that empower informed decision-making.
   To clearly visualize and identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies between demographic characteristics (like age, income, location, family size) and various types of expenses (e.g., healthcare, education, housing, consumer goods, public services). This helps in understanding "who is spending what, where, and why.
   To track changes over time in both population demographics and expense patterns, allowing for continuous assessment of the impact of various initiatives, economic shifts, or policy changes.
   Key Questions:
   * How has the age distribution of the population changed over the past X years?
* What are the trends in population growth or decline in specific regions or demographics?
* How much expenditure is there as per different age groups?
